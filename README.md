# C++ Console Curve Plotter

This project was made for a C++ class between January and June of 2019. The program is able to plot every polynomial or trigonometric function on a specified interval. The function should have one of the following format : 

- a
- ax
- x<sup>n</sup>
- ax<sup>n</sup>
- P
- cos(P)
- sin(P)
- a ∗ cos(P)
- ax ∗ cos(P)
- x<sup>n</sup> ∗ cos(P)
- ax<sup>n</sup> ∗ cos(P)

Where _a_ is a real number, _n_ is a positive integer and _P_ is a polynomial.

It will also print approximation of roots on the interval.

## Examples

![Plot of x<sup>2</sup>-2](/images/1.png)

This one is the plot of the function f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> - 2 between -3 and 3. You can also see the approximation of the roots √2 and -√2.

![Plot of cos(x)](/images/2.png)

This one is the plot of the function f(x) = cos(x) between -2π and 2π. You can also see the approximation of the roots -3π/2, -π/2, π/2 and 3π/2.

![Plot of x<sup>3</sup>-4x<sup>2</sup>](/images/3.PNG)

This one is the plot of the function f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup> between -1 and 5.
